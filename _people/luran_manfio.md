### About

Luran is a Junor in CALS(College).
I am currently working on pursuing my bachlors degree in biology and a minor in computor science with the goal to pursue a graduates degree.
I am currently doing research with Dr.Lemas within the metabolomics portion of his research. 
I was directed into Dr.Lemas's lab as a good bridge between several passions, medicene and technology.
Working with Dr.Lemas on this has allowed me to develope more skills and experence in several areas such as coding,experemental design,patient contact and interactions, etc.
I am working within the lab to develope skills and experence that will one day be translated into other lab work.


### Current Projects

- creating stable environment pipelines to allow for reproducible data 
- Assisting Dr.Lemas in different aspects of the Lab
